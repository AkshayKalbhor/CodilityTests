3: LocalCompany
Question:
    Write a function that takes a string input and returns the first character 
    that is not repeated anywhere in that string.

    As an added challenge upper and lower case letters are considered the same character 
    but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter.
    for eg: the input sTreSS should return T.

    If a string contains all repeating characters then it should return an empty string "".
